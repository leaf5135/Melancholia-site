## Navigation

When you hit **Start**, you’ll be taken to the **Song Select** screen. Use the **Next** and **Previous** buttons to browse through the available levels. There are **10 levels**, each featuring a unique piece of classical music. The first level is designed to get yourself familar with the game, and therefore the easiest. The remaining levels vary in difficulty.

You can also use keyboard shortcuts:
- **Z** → Previous song
- **X** → Next song
- **Spacebar** → Play the selected level
- **Esc** → Return to the home screen

---

Once you're in a level, you can pause at any time by pressing the **Spacebar**. Use this to:
- Restart the level
- Return to the main menu
- Take a break
- Or just admire the background art

Raw versions of the background images are available in the [Gallery](./gallery.md).

## Stances

When a level starts, you'll see notes moving in specific directions. The movement depends on the **stance** you choose.

### Conductor Stance

In this stance, **Chrono** (the protagonist) acts as a conductor. Notes fall from the top in four vertical columns.

To play:
- **Z** → Leftmost column
- **X** → Second column
- **N** → Third column
- **M** → Rightmost column

Your goal is to hit the notes **just before** they reach the magenta line.

### Performer Stance

Here, Chrono stands at the center of the stage. Notes fly toward him from four directions: north, south, west, and east.

To play:
- **W** → Notes from the north
- **S** → Notes from the south
- **A** → Notes from the west
- **D** → Notes from the east

Your goal is to hit the notes **just before they reach Chrono**.

## Hits

There are three types of note hits:

- **Accurate Hit**: Perfect timing. Heals a small amount of HP.
- **Inaccurate Hit**: Slightly too early. Small HP loss.
- **Miss**: Too early or too late. Significant HP loss.
